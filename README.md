st project testing
Project Description:
This project involves testing different APIs using the Mocha test framework and the Chai assertion library in Node.js. The APIs that are tested are the Suggestion API, the Color API, and the Category API.

Installation and Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine
Open the cloned folder in your code editor of choice
In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project and run npm install to install the project's dependencies.
To run the tests, execute npm test in the terminal.
APIs Tested

Suggestion API:

This API fetches suggested search terms from a specific website.
The test verifies that the API returns a status code of 200 and that the caption of the first group is "Suggested Searches".
Color API:

This API fetches product information based on a specific color.
The test verifies that the API returns a status code of 200 and that the title of the product is "Product 1".
Category API:

This API fetches subcategory information based on a specific category.
The test verifies that the API returns a status code of 200 and that the title of the subcategory is "Subcategory 1".
Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides a basic example of how to write API tests using Mocha and Chai in Node.js. The three APIs tested provide a simple but useful demonstration of how to test APIs and the kinds of tests that can be performed.
